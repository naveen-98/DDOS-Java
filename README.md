# DDOS-Java
Java Code is used to create DDOS Attack.

This is totally a DDOS attack I did. And this was done for educational purposes only. The language used for this is Java. This shows how to do a DDoS attack in a very simple and small way. 

A DDoS attack is an attempt by an individual or a group of individuals to create a node for a victim's website or its prospective users to refuse service. When an attack is made on one victim destination from different sources it is called DDoS. This attack is more powerful than the DoS attack. When it comes to moral intrusion, a DDoS attack is often referred to as a stress test.

I repeat, use this for educational purposes only.
